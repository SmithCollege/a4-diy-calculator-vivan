Reflection on your experience with this assignment: 

I thought this assignment was challenging, especially the infix implementation. I spent a lot of time reading through the shunt-yard algorithm wikipedia. The coding part of the infix method wasn't too hard, it was mainly understanding the logic of the algorithm. 

Being able to add debugging statements throughout my method was VERY helpful in determining what is going wrong (especially because of how long and complicated the algorithm is). Also, spending time reading through the Javadoc for ArrayDeque made this assignment a lot easier to understand and implement!

This assignment does lend itself to more visual prototyping, so please feel free to go this route. Are you including slides, pseudocode, comments, or something else?

No, but working through examples on paper was helpful.
